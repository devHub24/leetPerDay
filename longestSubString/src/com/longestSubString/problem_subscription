Here we go
The Question is to find the longest subString wuithout repeating characters
quite confusing?
let's break it down
Example
Str: abcabcbb
so here the substring are:
a
ab
abc
abca: this is an invalid substring since we have duplicate values in a sub string
so the valid sub strings for the given string is a, ab, abc, bc, bca, ca, cab
so the longest substring is abc
Another Example: pwwkew
 here the valid sub strings are: pw, wk,wke,ke  
 so the va;id substring is wke 
 
 the output for both the input is 3
