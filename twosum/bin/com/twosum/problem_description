Here is the problem description
//
So Given an array and a target value you have to find the pair of numbers in the array
that gives the target value when added up
//

Example:
arr:{1,2,3,4} target:4 
result:[1,3]

you may assume that each array will have only one solution and you should not use the same
element twice.

Examples:
nums=[2,7,11,1,5] target =9
result=[0,1]
because nums[0]+nums[1]=9
